# foreign-instruments-rs Roadmap

## Vision

Enable seamless integration and control of non-MIDI-class-compliant musical instruments (especially Native Instruments hardware) on modern systems using Rust. Provide a robust, extensible, and cross-platform interface for advanced device management, MIDI translation, and real-time interaction.

## High-Level Goals

1. **Device Discovery & Management**

    - Enumerate all connected USB and HID devices
    - Identify and filter supported instrument hardware (Native Instruments, etc.)
    - Support hotplug (dynamic connect/disconnect)

2. **MIDI Translation Layer**

    - Translate proprietary USB/HID protocols to standard MIDI messages
    - Expose a virtual MIDI port for DAWs and other software

3. **Advanced Device Features**

    - Support for LEDs, displays, smart strips, and other non-MIDI controls
    - Firmware update and diagnostics interface

4. **Cross-Platform Support**

    - Linux, macOS, and Windows compatibility

5. **Extensibility & Community**
    - Modular architecture for adding new devices and backends
    - Clear documentation and contribution guidelines

## Architecture Notes

### Event-Driven Design

-   **No polling loops**: All device communication should be event-driven
-   **Async/await**: Use Rust's async features for non-blocking operations
-   **Callbacks**: Implement proper callback mechanisms for device events

### Multi-Threaded Performance

-   **Input Thread**: Dedicated thread for receiving HID/USB events
-   **Output Thread**: Dedicated thread for sending MIDI messages
-   **Message Passing**: Use channels for communication between threads
-   **Real-time Priority**: Ensure MIDI output has minimal latency

### HID Protocol Support

-   **Maschine Jam**: Primary target device with specific HID protocol
-   **Generic HID**: Fallback support for other HID devices
-   **Bidirectional**: Support for both input and output HID reports
